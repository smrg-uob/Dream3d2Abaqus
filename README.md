# Dream3d2Abaqus
## Main Function
Convert microstructure information generated by Dream3d (opensource software which can be used to synthetically build different microstructure which can be found [here](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/)) to construct an Abaqus input file containing periodic boundary conditions.

The generated microstructure features and orientations are assigned to element sets in Abaqus with the corresponding material definition assigned via sections.

NOTE: New matlab file added which uses the ABAQUS filter in Dream3d.  I would advise using this version instead to generate the material files.  Please see the note at the bottom of the README.
## Dream3D Requirements
The minimum filter construction required is as follows:

Centroid information will be stored in the *csv* file (created using the *Export Feature Data as CSV File* filter), while node/element/orientation information is stored in the *.vox* file (created using the *Export Los Alamos FFT File* filter).
## Required informtion for Matlab function
To use the Matlab function, the *xlsx* file included here should be updated with the material parameters in the sheet (with the corresponding name) in the order provided in the pdf found [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jk2079/Kysar_Research_Laboratory/Single_Crystal_UMAT.html). 

The location of the centroid of each grain can be extracted from the generated *csv* file.  These values should be transferred to the *centroid* sheet in the *xlsx* file (inputfile_info)

## Installation
Simply copy files in the folder titled *Dream3d2Abaqus* into the MATLAB file path.

## Running the MATLAB function
Run from the command prompt the following:
*dream2abq('nameofvoxfile.vox','nameofinputfile.inp')*
where:
* nameofvoxfile = name of the vox file included in the same directly and which is exported using the *Export Los Alamos FFT File* filter
* nameofinpfule = is the name of the Abaqus input file you would like to create

## Applying loading for periodic boundary conditions
The loads should be applied ot the reference nodes (refnodeD, refnodeS, refnodeS2) in the following way:

To apply axial loading:
* x-direction: *refnodeD(load,0,0)*, *refnodeS(0,0,0)*, *refnodeS2(0,0,0)*
* y-direction: *refnodeD(0,load,0)*, *refnodeS(0,0,0)*, *refnodeS2(0,0,0)*
* z-direction: *refnodeD(0,0,load)*, *refnodeS(0,0,0)*, *refnodeS2(0,0,0)*

To apply shear loading:
* xy: *refnodeD(0,0,0)*, *refnodeS(0,0,0)*, *refnodeS2(0,load,0)*
* xz: *refnodeD(0,load,0)*, *refnodeS(0,0,0)*, *refnodeS2(0,0,load)*
* yz: *refnodeD(0,0,load)*, *refnodeS(0,0,load)*, *refnodeS2(0,0,0)*

## New Matlab file using ABAQUS filter in Dream3D
The Dream3d file (dream2abqN.m) which generates the data required by the function is included in the folder *ABQfilter*.  It will generate the input files and an additional file csv file which contains the euler angles for each grain.  These files should be included in your Matlab folder when running the function.

For the naming convention, you'll notice in the Dream3D filters *testcase__* is used.  Please ensure whatever name you use instead of testcase includes the double underscore after it.

To run the the function, use the following convention:

dream2abqN('testcase__'), where *testcase* can be replaced with whatever name you are using.
